### Hello there! 👋

🙋 My name is Simeón. I'm currently studying in the University of La Laguna, in Tenerife.

💻 I consider myself a very creative person, that's why I'm interested in web development. I'm currently studying front and back end development to be able to make my own personal website.

🎶 I'm also interested in music production. You can find my work on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/wololegend).

💬 Feel free to contact me via email: palomarblumenthaljaimesimeon@gmail.com
