### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ™‹ My name is SimeÃ³n. I'm currently studying remotely in the Online University of Catalonia.

ðŸ’» I consider myself a very creative person, that's why I'm interested in web development. I'm currently studying front and back end development to be able to make a reality out of any web project.

ðŸŽ¶ I'm also interested in music production. You can find my work on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/intl-es/artist/5WiEvKfRO6yv5STAhzL6fJ?si=QY840lRtQDqmw-ZfG-_pCw).

ðŸ’¬ Feel free to contact me via email: palomarblumenthaljaimesimeon@gmail.com
